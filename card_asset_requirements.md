# PNG Asset Requirements: Policy & Dilemma Cards (Monopoly Theme)

This document outlines the specifications for PNG image assets used for Standard Policy cards and Dilemma cards within the SFC Economic Strategy Game. The visual style should strongly adhere to a classic **Monopoly board game theme**.

## I. General Requirements

*   **Format:** PNG (with transparency where appropriate)
*   **Quantity:** 70 unique assets required (10 Standard Policy, 60 Dilemma).
*   **Naming Convention:** Use clear, descriptive filenames based on the card name (e.g., `interest_rate_hike.png`, `labor_market_discipline_dilemma.png`). Use lowercase and underscores.

## II. Dimensions

*   **Standard Size:** 600 pixels (width) x 900 pixels (height)
*   **Aspect Ratio:** 2:3 (Consistent with many standard playing cards)
*   **Resolution:** Minimum 72 DPI (suitable for screen display)

## III. Stylistic Guidelines (Monopoly Theme)

The overall aesthetic should evoke the feeling of playing Monopoly. Think Chance/Community Chest cards, property deeds, and the game board itself.

*   **Color Palette:**
    *   Primarily use the classic Monopoly color palette: Deep Green (board background), Cream/Off-White (card backgrounds), Red (accents, property bars), Black (text, borders), Yellow/Orange/Light Blue/Pink/Magenta (property group colors for potential accents or card type distinctions).
    *   Use colors purposefully to potentially distinguish card types (see below).
*   **Typography:**
    *   **Titles:** Use a bold, sans-serif font reminiscent of Monopoly property names (e.g., Kabel Bold, Century Gothic Bold, or a similar freely available alternative). ALL CAPS is recommended for titles.
    *   **Body/Flavor Text (If any shown on card):** Use a clear, readable serif or sans-serif font appropriate for the theme (e.g., Times New Roman, Arial).
*   **Iconography & Imagery:**
    *   **Style:** Simple, clear line art or silhouette style, similar to icons on Chance/Community Chest cards (e.g., money bags, top hat, car, question mark, chest).
    *   **Content:** Icons should visually represent the card's theme (e.g., upward/downward arrows for rates/spending, factory for investment, scales for tax balance, gavel for regulation, question mark for dilemmas).
    *   **Avoid:** Photorealistic images or overly complex illustrations.
*   **Layout & Feel:**
    *   **Borders:** Consider simple black line borders, potentially with rounded corners.
    *   **Background:** Cream/Off-white base, potentially with subtle texture (like aged paper or linen).
    *   **Title Area:** A distinct banner or colored bar at the top for the card title, similar to property deeds.
    *   **Icon Area:** A central area dedicated to the main icon/illustration.
    *   **Text Area (If needed):** Clear space below the icon for any essential keywords or brief flavor text snippets (though most text will be in the UI, not the asset itself).
    *   **Inspiration:** Look at Monopoly Chance/Community Chest cards and Property Deeds for layout structure. Incorporate subtle board game elements if possible (e.g., corner squares motifs, railroad icon style).
*   **Distinguishing Card Types:**
    *   **Standard vs. Dilemma:** Dilemma cards could use a distinct background color tint (e.g., slightly darker cream), a different border style, or a prominent "Dilemma" icon (like a large question mark or crossroads symbol).
    *   **Expansionary vs. Contractionary (Standard):** Could be subtly indicated by icon direction (up/down arrows), color accents (e.g., green tint for expansionary, red tint for contractionary), or small symbols (+/-). Consistency is key.

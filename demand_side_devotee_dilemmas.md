# Demand Side Devotee Dilemmas (Conceptual)

**Note:** Parameter changes mentioned in parentheses (e.g., `GRg` increase) describe the *intended conceptual outcome* or flavor. The actual mechanic involves adding/removing the specified unique cards. The exact effects of these unique cards need calibration later.

**Dilemma 1: Fiscal Stimulus Delivery Mechanism**
*   **Flavor Text:** The economy needs a significant boost! Should we inject demand through large-scale public projects or by putting spending money directly into consumers' hands?
*   **Option A: Launch Major Public Works**
    *   **Flavour:** Investing in infrastructure creates jobs and tangible assets, though the economic impact might take time to materialize.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Shovel-Ready Infrastructure Projects'** cards (Effect: Significant `GRg` increase; conceptually may slightly boost `GRpr` long-term). Remove one 'Cut Income Tax Rate' card.

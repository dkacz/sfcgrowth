# Austerity Apostle Dilemmas (Conceptual)

**Note:** Parameter changes mentioned in parentheses (e.g., `GRg` decrease) describe the *intended conceptual outcome* or flavor. The actual mechanic involves adding/removing the specified unique cards. The exact effects of these unique cards need calibration later.

---

**Dilemma 1: Labor Market Discipline**
*   **Flavor Text:** To truly control inflation and costs, the labor market needs discipline. Should we focus on weakening wage demands directly or reducing job security?
*   **Option A: Curb Wage Aspirations**
    *   **Flavour:** Directly suppressing wage growth aims to break inflationary spirals at the source, though it risks social unrest.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Wage Suppression Mandate'** cards (Effect: Conceptually decreases `omega1` & `omega2`). Add one 'Interest Rate Hike' card.
*   **Option B: Increase 'Flexibility' (Precariousness)**
    *   **Flavour:** Making hiring and firing easier might boost business confidence, but could lead to widespread job insecurity and lower morale.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Labor Market Flexibility Reform'** cards (Effect: Widens the employment stability band (`BANDt`/`BANDb`), making wages less sensitive to employment changes within the band). Add one 'Make Tax System Less Progressive' card.

---

**Dilemma 2: Banking Sector Prudence**
*   **Flavor Text:** A stable financial system is paramount for austerity to work. Should we enforce stricter capital rules or encourage banks to hold more liquid assets?
*   **Option A: Fortify Bank Capital**
    *   **Flavour:** Requiring banks to hold more capital makes them safer against losses, potentially reducing lending activity.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Bank Capital Fortification'** cards (Effect: Conceptually increases `NCAR`). Add one 'Quantitative Tightening' card.
*   **Option B: Mandate Liquidity Hoarding**
    *   **Flavour:** Forcing banks to hold more cash ensures they can meet obligations, but might starve the economy of credit.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Bank Liquidity Mandate'** cards (Effect: Conceptually increases `bot`). Add one 'Decrease Government Spending' card.

---

**Dilemma 3: Investment Climate for Austerity**
*   **Flavor Text:** Even during austerity, some investment is needed. Should we incentivize it through deregulation, hoping for efficiency gains, or accept lower growth as a price for stability?
*   **Option A: Deregulate for Efficiency**
    *   **Flavour:** Cutting red tape could unleash private sector dynamism, but might also invite risky behaviour and neglect externalities.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add one **'Austerity Deregulation Package'** card (Effect: Conceptually increases `GRpr` but also `NPLk`). Remove one 'Raise Income Tax Rate' card.
*   **Option B: Prioritize Stability Over Growth**
    *   **Flavour:** Accepting slower growth prioritizes fiscal consolidation and stability, potentially delaying recovery but ensuring control.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Investment Dampening Measures'** cards (Effect: Conceptually decreases `gamma0` & `gammau`). Add two 'Interest Rate Hike' cards.

---

**Dilemma 4: Public Sector Reform Strategy**
*   **Flavor Text:** The state apparatus itself is inefficient and costly. How best to impose fiscal discipline on the public sector?
*   **Option A: Privatize State Assets**
    *   **Flavour:** Selling state assets provides immediate revenue and shrinks the state, but might lead to monopolies or loss of essential services.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'State Asset Privatization'** cards (Effect: Moderate `GRg` decrease, slight `theta` decrease). Remove one 'Decrease Government Spending' card.
*   **Option B: Implement Deep Civil Service Cuts**
    *   **Flavour:** Reducing the public workforce cuts government costs significantly, but risks damaging service delivery and increasing unemployment.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Civil Service Rationalization'** cards (Effect: Significant `GRg` decrease; conceptually may slightly increase `omega0`). Remove one 'Raise Income Tax Rate' card.

---

**Dilemma 5: Managing Household Debt Burden**
*   **Flavor Text:** While not the primary focus, excessive household debt could destabilize the economy during austerity. Should we encourage faster repayment or simply let tighter credit handle it?
*   **Option A: Promote Accelerated Deleveraging**
    *   **Flavour:** Pushing households to repay debt faster strengthens balance sheets but reduces consumer spending in the short term.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Forced Deleveraging Initiative'** cards (Effect: Increases `deltarep`; slightly decreases `alpha1`). Remove one random expansionary card.
*   **Option B: Rely on Credit Market Discipline**
    *   **Flavour:** Allowing tighter credit conditions to naturally curb borrowing avoids direct intervention but might take longer and be less predictable.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Credit Market Discipline'** cards (Effect: Decreases `eta0`; increases `etar`). Remove one random expansionary card.

---

**Dilemma 6: Tax Structure for Fiscal Health**
*   **Flavor Text:** Raising revenue is necessary, but the structure matters. Should we focus on broad-based consumption taxes or ensure *everyone* contributes more via income taxes by simplifying the system?
*   **Option A: Shift Towards Consumption Taxes**
    *   **Flavour:** Taxing consumption hits spending directly and can be efficient, but disproportionately affects lower-income households.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Consumption Tax Shift'** cards (Effect: Moderate `theta` increase; significant `alpha1` decrease). Remove one 'Make Tax System Less Progressive' card.
*   **Option B: Broaden the Income Tax Base**
    *   **Flavour:** Making the income tax system simpler and broader ensures wider contribution, though it might stifle work incentives for some.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Income Tax Base Broadening'** cards (Effect: Significant `theta` increase; moderate `alpha1` decrease). Remove one 'Decrease Government Spending' card.

---

**Dilemma 7: Inflation Expectations Management**
*   **Flavor Text:** Inflationary psychology is taking hold. Should we anchor expectations through aggressive monetary signals or by demonstrating unwavering fiscal resolve?
*   **Option A: Monetary Shock & Awe**
    *   **Flavour:** A sharp, decisive monetary tightening sends a clear signal against inflation, but risks triggering a deep recession.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Monetary Credibility Shock'** cards (Effect: Significant `Rbbar` increase; moderate `ADDbl` increase). Remove one 'Decrease Government Spending' card.
*   **Option B: Fiscal Credibility Signal**
    *   **Flavour:** Demonstrating unwavering commitment to spending cuts aims to build credibility slowly, hoping to influence expectations without a monetary shock.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Fiscal Resolve Signal'** cards (Effect: Significant `GRg` decrease; moderate `theta` increase; conceptually decreases `eps`). Remove one 'Interest Rate Hike' card.

---

**Dilemma 8: Capital Investment vs. Debt Reduction**
*   **Flavor Text:** Even in austerity, some capital depreciates (`delta`). Should we allow minimal replacement investment, or prioritize debt reduction above all else?
*   **Option A: Minimal Capital Maintenance**
    *   **Flavour:** Maintaining essential infrastructure prevents long-term decay, requiring careful budgeting within tight constraints.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add one **'Austerity-Funded Capital Maintenance'** card (Effect: Slight `GRpr` increase offset by moderate `theta` increase). Remove one 'Quantitative Tightening' card.
*   **Option B: Accelerate Capital Depreciation**
    *   **Flavour:** Letting capital depreciate faster maximizes immediate savings, accepting the future cost of rebuilding or lower productivity.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Accelerated Capital Decay Savings'** cards (Effect: Significant `GRg` decrease; conceptually increases `delta`). Remove one 'Make Tax System Less Progressive' card.

---

**Dilemma 9: Response to External Shocks**
*   **Flavor Text:** An external shock threatens inflation and the deficit. Double down on austerity, or rely solely on the Central Bank to contain inflation?
*   **Option A: Double Down on Austerity**
    *   **Flavour:** Intensifying austerity measures in response to a shock shows resolve but risks deepening the downturn.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add one **'Austerity Intensification Protocol'** card (Effect: Transforms next two contractionary cards into stronger versions). Remove one random expansionary card.
*   **Option B: Rely on Monetary Containment**
    *   **Flavour:** Leaving the response entirely to the central bank avoids further fiscal pain but tests the limits of monetary policy.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Monetary Containment Response'** cards (Effect: Significant `Rbbar` & `ADDbl` increase; slight `eta0` decrease). Remove one 'Decrease Government Spending' card.

---

**Dilemma 10: Financial Market Stability**
*   **Flavor Text:** Financial speculation seems detached from the real economy's adjustments. How do we ensure stability?
*   **Option A: Impose Regulatory Constraints**
    *   **Flavour:** Tightening financial rules can prevent bubbles and crashes, potentially at the cost of financial innovation and market liquidity.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Financial Regulation Tightening'** cards (Effect: Moderately increases `NCAR`; slightly increases `ro`). Remove one 'Decrease Government Spending' card.
*   **Option B: Let Monetary Policy Cool Markets**
    *   **Flavour:** Using interest rates to cool speculative fervour is a blunt instrument that affects the entire economy, not just the financial sector.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Market Cooling Rate Hikes'** cards (Effect: Significant `Rbbar` increase; moderate `ADDbl` increase). Remove one 'Raise Income Tax Rate' card.

---

**Dilemma 11: Long-Term Productivity vs. Short-Term Cuts**
*   **Flavor Text:** Stagnant productivity (`GRpr`) could undermine long-term fiscal health. Risk a small, targeted public investment, or maintain absolute fiscal discipline *now*?
*   **Option A: Austere Investment in Productivity**
    *   **Flavour:** A small, targeted investment aims to boost future growth potential, a calculated risk against the austerity doctrine.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add one **'Tax-Funded Productivity Initiative'** card (Effect: Slight `GRpr` increase funded by moderate `theta` increase). Remove one 'Decrease Government Spending' card.
*   **Option B: Unwavering Fiscal Discipline**
    *   **Flavour:** Maintaining absolute fiscal discipline reinforces the core message, prioritizing immediate stability over uncertain future gains.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Unwavering Fiscal Discipline'** cards (Effect: Significant `GRg` decrease; conceptually slightly decreases `GRpr`). Remove one 'Interest Rate Hike' card.

---

**Dilemma 12: Managing Public Perception & Expectations**
*   **Flavor Text:** Public discontent with austerity is rising. Offer a minor, symbolic tax adjustment, or reinforce the message that austerity is non-negotiable?
*   **Option A: Symbolic Tax Appeasement**
    *   **Flavour:** A small concession might temporarily ease public pressure, but could be seen as weakness or insufficient.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add one **'Symbolic Tax Appeasement'** card (Effect: Slight `theta` decrease; slight `alpha1` decrease - regressive cut concept). Remove one 'Decrease Government Spending' card.
*   **Option B: Reinforce Austerity Resolve**
    *   **Flavour:** Doubling down on the austerity message leaves no room for doubt, potentially hardening opposition but maintaining policy direction.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Reinforce Austerity Resolve'** cards (Effect: Moderate `Rbbar` increase; conceptually decreases `eps`). Remove one 'Make Tax System Less Progressive' card.

---

**Dilemma 13: Financing the Remaining Deficit**
*   **Flavor Text:** Compel banks to absorb government debt, or cut spending even deeper?
*   **Option A: Mandate Bank Purchases of Gov. Debt**
    *   **Flavour:** Forcing banks to buy government bonds secures funding but can crowd out private lending and distort financial markets.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Forced Lending Mandate'** cards (Effect: Slightly increases `bot`/`top` liquidity bounds temporarily; may slightly decrease `eta0`). Remove one 'Decrease Government Spending' card.
*   **Option B: Minimize Government Borrowing Needs**
    *   **Flavour:** Cutting spending further avoids increasing debt burdens but deepens the immediate economic pain and service cuts.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Emergency Fiscal Retrenchment'** cards (Effect: Very large decrease in `GRg`; moderate increase in `theta`). Remove one 'Interest Rate Hike' card.

---

**Dilemma 14: Infrastructure Maintenance vs. Immediate Savings**
*   **Flavor Text:** Deferring infrastructure maintenance saves money now but increases long-term decay (`delta`). Is the immediate saving worth the long-term cost?
*   **Option A: Slash Maintenance Budgets**
    *   **Flavour:** Deferring maintenance offers immediate budget relief but guarantees higher costs and potential failures down the line.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Deferred Maintenance Savings'** cards (Effect: Significant decrease in `GRg`; conceptually leads to higher `delta` over time). Remove one 'Make Tax System Less Progressive' card.
*   **Option B: Implement 'Efficiency Savings' in Maintenance**
    *   **Flavour:** Attempting 'efficiency savings' aims for a middle ground, but risks being insufficient or masking deeper cuts.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Restructured Maintenance Levy'** cards (Effect: Moderate decrease in `GRg`; moderate increase in `theta`; conceptually leads to slightly lower `GRpr`). Remove one 'Decrease Government Spending' card.

---

**Dilemma 15: Political Capital Burn Rate**
*   **Flavor Text:** Push through the harshest reforms now, or adopt a slightly more gradual approach?
*   **Option A: Rip Off the Band-Aid**
    *   **Flavour:** Implementing all painful reforms quickly gets them over with, but maximizes the immediate political and social shock.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add one **'Austerity Blitz'** card (Effect: Applies large, simultaneous decrease to `GRg` and increase to `theta` & `Rbbar`; conceptually lowers `eps`). Remove one random expansionary card (if any).
*   **Option B: Gradual Implementation (Relatively Speaking)**
    *   **Flavour:** A more measured pace might be politically sustainable but prolongs the period of adjustment and uncertainty.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Sustained Fiscal Squeeze'** cards (Effect: Moderate decrease in `GRg` and moderate increase in `theta`; conceptually increases `omega3` slightly). Remove one 'Quantitative Tightening' card.

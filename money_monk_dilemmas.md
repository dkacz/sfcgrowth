# Money Monk Dilemmas (Conceptual)

**Note:** Parameter changes mentioned in parentheses (e.g., `Rbbar` increase) describe the *intended conceptual outcome* or flavor. The actual mechanic involves adding/removing the specified unique cards. The exact effects of these unique cards need calibration later.

**Dilemma 1: Primary Inflation Control Tool**
*   **Flavor Text:** Inflation is ticking up! Rely on traditional short-term rate (`Rbbar`) hikes, or use quantitative tightening (QT) to drain liquidity (`ADDbl`)?
*   **Option A: Orthodox Rate Hike**
    *   **Flavour:** The traditional tool: raise short-term rates to make borrowing more expensive across the economy.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add two **'Steadfast Rate Increase'** cards (Effect: Significant `Rbbar` increase). Remove one 'Quantitative Tightening' card.
*   **Option B: Aggressive Quantitative Tightening**
    *   **Flavour:** Reduce the money supply directly by selling assets, aiming to tighten financial conditions broadly.

**Dilemma 2: Managing Inflation Expectations**
*   **Flavor Text:** Deliver a sharp, painful monetary shock now, or signal a prolonged period of tight money?
*   **Option A: Short, Sharp Monetary Shock**
    *   **Flavour:** A sudden, sharp increase in rates aims to break inflation expectations quickly, even if it causes significant economic pain.
    *   **Effect on Deck:** Add one **'Monetary Shock Therapy'** card (Effect: Very large simultaneous increase in `Rbbar` and `ADDbl` for one turn). Remove one 'Decrease Government Spending' card.
